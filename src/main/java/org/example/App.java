/**
 * Hello world!
 *
 * Using Vehicle as a base class, create three derived classes (Car, Motorbike, etc.).
 * Each derived class should have its own attributes in addition to the normal Vehicle attributes.
 *
 * Using an array, store all your Vehicles in a Garage class.
 *
 * Create a method in Garage that iterates through each Vehicle,
 * calculating a bill for each type of Vehicle in a different way,
 * depending on the type of Vehicle it is (this does not need to be complex).
 *
 * Garage should have methods that add a Vehicle, remove a Vehicle 
 * by its ID or its type, fix a Vehicle (which calculates the bill) and to empty the Garage.
 *
 * Garage should have a method to remove multiple Vehicles by their type.
